## Goal: 

Hacking wakatime :laughing::sweat_smile: and learning Go.

## How it Works:

It is a TUI application written in go using [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) library that once executed will produce heartbeats of the programming languages the user inputs when prompted and keep running forever until user explicitly closes the application.
